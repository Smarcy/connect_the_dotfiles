### Disclaimer

This software is just a hobby project. I created it mainly for my own use because
I wanted to be able to organize my dotfiles comfortably exactly the way I wish to.
Use this piece of software **at your own risk**.

If you do not read carefully before you type, **you may mess up your system irreversibly**.

This software does create symlinks on your machine and even, if wanted, delete files.
Thus, **think** before you type. Even better: study the source code.

### Functionality

- Gather all your configuration files in a single directory
  - It is recommended to make that specific directory verison controlled (e.g. `Git`)
- Let `CTD` automatically create links at the needed location

### Info

Relevant directories:

* `~/.config/ctd/`
* `~/.config/ctd/dotfiles`
* `~/.config/ctd/backups`


### Future Ideas

This is the first version that is even running and working,
therefore it is not doing too much yet and I'm not even sure yet where this
funny journey will lead to.

### TODO

* [ ] Remove existing files
* [ ] Link only selected files
* [ ] Link only unlinked files

To be continued
